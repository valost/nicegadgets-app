# Description
This React app, written in TypeScript, includes a home page where users can view sliders featuring new models, hot prices, and product categories. The three main categories are phones, tablets, and accessories (including smartwatches).

On each product page, users can sort products by year, name, and price. Additionally, the app provides a search bar where users can input specific details such as model, color, and memory capacity to find products. By clicking on a product card, users can view a detailed description of the selected item and explore available color and memory options.

The app also allows users to add or remove products from their favorites and shopping cart. In the shopping cart, users can view the total price of their selected items, and they can add or remove products as needed.

Lastly, the app features both light and dark themes, which can be toggled by the user.
